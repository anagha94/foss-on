<p>This project (apart from earning us 10 marks. :P) is also going to be a birthday gift for one of our closest friends.
We won't be revealing much here since we don't want the surprise to be spoilt</p>

<p>She's quite a public figure with a facebook fan page of her own so I'm sure all you fangirls and fanboys out there will be equally excited about this project as much as we are.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you will have to wait till April 20th to know what it is, but I promise you it's worth the wait. :D</p>

<p>Keep visiting our site, we might throw a couple of hints on what this is about. ;)</p>
